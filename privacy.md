Information we hold is made available to the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform from their original trials following Data protection impact assessments and Data Sharing Agreements made with the original Data Controllers. The privacy notices for this data can be found with the original trials and data is stored securely as described in our [platform documentation](/platform/).

The information you provide will be used by the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform to respond to enquiries, and to facilitate access to the platform including creating the agreements and user accounts within our Trusted Research Environments required to access data stored in the platform.

We may share this information with the University of Edinburgh and Public Health Scotland as the operators of the ODAP Trusted Research Environments and with the Data Controllers or their representatives for datasets contained within the platform as may be required to facilitate your data access request.

We are using information about you because it is necessary for the performance of your contract with us, or because you have asked us to take specific steps before entering into a contract such as a data sharing agreement.

## Data sharing
In addition to the primary purposes, we are also legally obliged to share certain data with other public bodies such as HMRC and will do so where the law requires this; we will also generally comply with requests for specific information from other regulatory and law enforcement bodies where this is necessary and proportionate.

If you wish to make use of one of these rights, please email your local contact.

If we have asked for your consent in order to process your personal data you can withdraw this consent in whole or part at any time.
