<p>We are a UK-wide consortium of doctors and scientists committed to answering urgent questions about COVID-19 quickly, openly, and for the benefit of all. Over the last 9 years we have been preparing for such a major outbreak worldwide <a href="https://isaric.net/ccp">International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterisation Protocol</a>; our team deployed immediately and has been collecting data and samples since the first cases were reported in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>

<p><span id="date">We</span> have recruited:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span id="num-tier-0">298,836</span> patients at Tier Zero case report forms(CO-CIN)</li>
  <li><span id="num-tier-2">2,505</span> patients at Tier 1/2 (host/viral multiomics)</li>
  <li><span id="num-tier-0">18,158</span> critically-ill patients can also be recruited to a sister study, the <a href="https://genomicc.org">ISARIC GenOMICC study</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysis-platform">Analysis Platform</h2>

<p>The ISARIC4C study has created an open-access <a href="analysis-platform">integrated analysis platform</a> for linked clincal data from across the NHS for a range of studies, including ISARIC4C, GenOMICC, PHOSP, COG-UK and UK-CIC.</p>

<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>

<p>ISARIC4C is funded by two major awards from UK Reasearch and Inovation (UKRI) and The National Institute For Health Research (NIHR). We share data and samples to get answers as fast as possible. We will not end this outbreak sitting on a biobank; our intention is to use every drop of every sample, now, to have the biggest possible impact on the COVID-19 crisis. Any investigators with the ability to contribute can <a href="sample_access">access our data and samples</a>. The ISARIC4C study provides a foundation for other studies, such as clinical trials of new treatments, to help better understand the best way to use interventions.</p>
