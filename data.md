# Data available within ODAP [^1] [^2]

ODAP holds unique and growing aggregation of UK sovereign data assets. Over time we aim to include more assets to incurage further research into the emerging and re-emerging pathogens or exposures of public health interest. The most up-to-date list of available data-sets is available on on the [HDR Gateway](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/) and more detailed data dictionary on the [ODAP Wiki](https://github.com/isaric4c/wiki). 

The following key data sets are available: [^3]
-   ISARIC4C/CO-CIN - clinical measurements and characterisation of COVID-19 patients  
-   GenOMICC – whole genome sequencing and genotyping of severe and mild COVID-19 patients 
-   PHOSP – long term follow up of COVID-19 patients) 

Further information is available on the [HDR Gateway](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/) and the [ODAP Wiki](https://github.com/isaric4c/wiki).

-   Linked cases with both virus and host genomes - ~15,000 cases 
-   RECOVERY trial – randomised control trial of treatments for COVID-19 disease.

(note: there will no longer be a distinction between the safehaven tre and the flexi/odap tre, we'll need to rewrite some of this text as that change happens. - Jack Oliver)

[^2]: The list of data already needs to be kept upto date on the HDR Gateway, rather than duplicating that work can we link to the Gateway for this information. - Jack Oliver
