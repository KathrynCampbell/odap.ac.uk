## Red Button

*Clinician-led all-threats surveillance in critical care.*

We can't know, in advance, what the next outbreak will look like. What we do know is that astute clinicians will notice the pattern and sound the alarm. The *unusual case button* is a standardised tool, inserted into existing data gathering systems, to lower the threshold for clinicians to flag cases that might indicate a new threat.

SARS, Swine Flu, MERS, Ebola, Bird Flu and Covid were all first detected in the same way: a clinician noticed an unusual cluster of critical illness. But in every one of these examples, patients with severe disease were missed in the weeks and months before the world was alerted. We need to pick up these early, single cases of unusual illness, before the outbreak is so severe that multiple cases are seen by the same clinician. 


## The "unusual case" red button

The challenge for surveillance is not technology. It is human. We need to harness clinical acumen, by making it easy for clinicians across the world to flag cases unusual patterns of disease - severe disease in otherwise healthy people, new or unexplained clinical patterns, or unexpected events. The threshold for reporting a case to public health is too high. We need to encourage clinicians to report a case when the first eyebrow is raised, not when the alarms are going off. Since the clinical features of the next outbreak cannot be known, we need to trust clinicians to spot unusual disease.

## How it works

An "unusual case button" is inserted into multiple existing audit and research studies. The approach is simple - the doctor or nurse completing audit or research data collection is asked a single question at the same time as they are already entering data for a patient: 

`do you think this patient's illness is unusual*?`

`* tick this box if you think that this patient's illness is unusually severe, or has unusual or unexplained clinical features. Imagine if you had 2 or 3 similar patients at the same time - would you consider the possibility of a new illness or outbreak? If so, check this box. ** Note: contact public health immediately if you think you have identified a new outbreak.** `

![Operation of unusual case critical illness surveillance system. When a new outbreak begins, patients present one by one, sporadically, to several different intensive care units. Currently, the outbreak is not detected until a single clinician sees several cases and notices the pattern. With unusual case detection, the very first cases may be identified and detected using advanced diagnostics, in time for public health measures to contain the outbreak.](/assets/img/art/red-button-text.svg)

Corroboration for a single user's opinion can be obtained from multiple sources (e.g. clinical audit and research data combined) and patterns can be identified automatically. Data can be integrated in a secure trusted research environment at a national level and shared immediately through an automated system (API) to public health agencies, other trusted research environments to accelerated detection and discovery.

Data will piped immediately through an existing structure ([outbreak API](https://isaric4c.net/ap)) to public health agencies, trusted research envorinments (including Office for National Statistics), and the data contributors, to accelerate detection and discovery.

In each location a variety of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, drawing on and combining with other data, can then be used to identify new outbreaks, variants and other threats.

## Action: advanced pathogen diagnostics

In some cases, no action will be taken. Where there is reasonable reason for suspicion (e.g. multiple independent reports; raised threat level) public health and standard reference laboratory clinical methods will be deployed within existing systems to investigate with additional diagnostic tests. In addition, access to novel diagnostic methods can be provided through academic laboratories and, with appropriate consent, host genomics.
