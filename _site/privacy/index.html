<h2 id="what-is-ccp-uk">What is CCP-UK?</h2>

<p>CCP-UK is a research study involving people with infections. The aims of
the CCP-UK study include gaining important information about infections
which are of public health interest, and finding better ways to manage
and treat these infections in the future.</p>

<p>CCP-UK has been classified as an Urgent Public Health Research study by
the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).</p>

<p>CCP-UK collects medical information about patients from NHS Trusts
across the UK. This data will be used for the purposes of the CCP-UK
study, which has received full approval from a research Ethics Committee
(13/SC/0149, Oxford C Research Ethics Committee). The CCP-UK data will
be stored indefinitely, because it will be of considerable importance to
future generations facing similar outbreaks of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>The CCP-UK study is made up of three tiers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 0 – data collection only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tiers 1 and 2 – data collection and human tissue sample collection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data is collected from NHS Trusts across the UK and transferred to
authorised members of the CCP-UK research team, which includes staff
from the University of Oxford, the University of Liverpool, The
University of Edinburgh, Imperial College London and Public Health
England. Samples are collected from NHS Trusts and transferred to the
Outbreak Laboratory at the University of Liverpool, Imperial College
London, Public Health England or the Roslin Institute at the University
of Edinburgh. Personal data accompanies each sample.</p>

<p>Patients in Tiers 1 and 2 will have consented to the CCP-UK study and
received a detailed information sheet when they were in hospital.
Patients in Tier 0 did not provide consent and no information on the
study has been provided to them – this was not needed at the time of
initial data collection, as this data was fully anonymous. A copy of the
current CCP-UK Patient Information Sheet is available to view 
<a href="https://isaric4c.net/setup">here</a>.</p>

<p>With the recent emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic, CCP-UK is making
changes to what data is being collected and the way the data is being
used.</p>

<p>Additional data is now being collected, including NHS Numbers (CHI
number in Scotland) and postcode. The purpose of collecting NHS numbers
is two-fold:</p>

<p>1)  NHS Digital data to be used in the CCP-UK study – NHS numbers and
    other direct identifiers such as postcode will be transferred by the
    CCP-UK research team to NHS Digital in order to submit a data
    application request. NHS Digital will use these direct identifiers
    to prepare a medical dataset. NHS Digital will then strip out all
    direct identifiers, and provide this to the CCP-UK research team.</p>

<p>2)  Data sharing with other research projects looking at COVID-19 –
    These research projects will be linked to the CCP-UK study, but have
    their own approvals in place. Details on those projects can be found
    <a href="https://isaric4c.net/sample_access">here</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the collection of NHS numbers, the data for Tier 0 patients is
now identifiable.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-university-of-oxford-use-and-protect-my-data">How does The University of Oxford use and protect my data?</h2>

<p>Research is a task that we perform in the public interest. The
University of Oxford, as sponsor, is the data controller. This means
that we, as University of Oxford researchers, are responsible for
looking after your information and using it properly. We will use the
minimum personally-identifiable information possible.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the processing and storage of personal data for
[study] is that it is ‘a task in the public interest’ (article
6(1)(e)) and, that sensitive personal data is necessary for archiving
purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
purposes or statistical purposes (article 9 (2) (j), based on Article
89(1)).</p>

<h3 id="participants-in-england-and-wales">Participants in England and Wales:</h3>

<p>We will send your unique study number, NHS number, date of birth, 
postcode and gender to NHS Digital or its successor NHSx. This allows
them to retrieve data from routine records about your hospital visits 
and care, which they will then return to us. The data that we receive 
back and analyse will be identified by a study number only, and will 
not be identified by name, date of birth, NHS number or address. The 
information received from NHS Digital or NHSx will be imported into an 
intermediate database held by Arden and GEM Commissioning Support Unit (CSU)
in a secure environment called a Safe Haven. Before retrieving data from
the Safe Haven for analysing with the study data, all personal identifiers
will be removed. Importantly, whilst the information received is specific 
to each trial participant, no individual person will be identifiable in
any publication arising from this work. Your personal data will not be 
shared with any 3rd parties outside of the CCP-UK trial team and will not
be used for any automated decision making or profiling. If you would like 
to have this data withdrawn, please contact the study team using the details given below.</p>

<p>Consent is not needed to obtain and use this extra data as described above, 
because on 20th March 2020, the DHSC issued notice under Regulation 3(4) of
the Health Service Control of Patient Information Regulations 2002 
(COPI Reg 3(4) for short).This COPI Reg 3(4) notice requires confidential 
information to be processed and disseminated for COVID-19 purposes only. 
The COPI notice has since been extended multiple times, most recently on 
27th August 2021 which allows for its use until 31st March 2022 (status last 
reviewed by ISARIC4C investigators on 18th November 2021).</p>

<h3 id="participants-in-scotland">Participants in Scotland:</h3>

<p>We will send your unique study number, CHI number, date of birth, postcode 
and gender to NHS Scotland. This allows them to retrieve data from routine 
records (held by NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, GPs and National 
Records of Scotland) about your hospital visits and care, which they will 
then return to us. The data that we receive back and analyse will be identified
by a study number only, and will not be identified by name, date of birth, 
CHI number or address. The information received from these data sources will 
be imported into an intermediate database held by Arden and 
GEM Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) in a secure environment called a Safe Haven. 
Before retrieving data from the Safe Haven for analysing with the study data, 
all personal identifiers will be removed. Importantly, whilst the information 
received is specific to each trial participant, no individual person will be
identifiable in any publication arising from this work. Your personal data will
not be shared with any 3rd parties outside of the CCP-UK trial team and will not 
be used for any automated decision making or profiling. If you would like to have
this data withdrawn, please contact the study team using the details given below.</p>

<p>Consent is not needed to obtain and use this extra data as described above, 
because we received approval from the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel (PBPP) 
for Health and Social Care on 17th April 2020 to link participant identifiers 
to routine data held by NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, GPs and National 
Records of Scotland. The PBPP approval is in place until 31st May 2022, after 
which the study team will apply to extend the approval if data processing is ongoing.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next?</h2>

<p>If you decide you do not want your data to be linked in this way you can withdraw 
from this follow-up, without affecting your current medical care, by contacting 
the study team, who would require your identifiers to ensure that your data is 
not included in the cohort. We will not request data from NHS Digital for anyone 
who directly requests not to be included. If we have already received your data by 
the time you indicate that you do not want your study data linked to routine records 
then we will remove your identifiers from our dataset.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-opt-out">How to opt out</h2>
<p>If after reading this you wish to opt out of this study by having your data removed please email <strong><a href="mailto:ccp@liverpool.ac.uk">ccp@liverpool.ac.uk</a></strong> including your name, date of birth, NHS number, and post code.
We will look for your details in our data and if we find it we will delete it. In any case we will email back to you within 14days to tell you if we found your data and if we did to confirm that your data has been removed.</p>

<p>Data protection regulation provides you with control over your personal data and 
how it is used. When your information is being used in research, however, some of
those rights may be limited in order for the research to be reliable and accurate.
