# Intended website layout
This branch contains the actual copy intended for use on the website but not yet live with each file representing an actual page on the website. May also be used for development work as well as copyediting. 

## Minimal acceptable content
This set of pages and layout is the minimum amount of information we can launch the ODAP with, with the intention that more content will be added later. These are the core pages that must be done to launch the site. Pages to consider adding once these are complete: FAQ, Outputs, Staff Pages.
